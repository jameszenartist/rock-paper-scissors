### Welcome to my Rock Paper Scissors Game using React!

<br />

While I've been building my confidence and abilities with React & overall code structure, I decided to build a rock paper scissors application with the React framework!

For the most part, I decided to use this project to target personal challenges, such as using various hooks, manipulating state within components, building a clean & efficient structural hierarchy, and the necessary game logic.

### Thanks for looking!
